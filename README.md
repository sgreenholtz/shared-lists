# Shared Lists App
Using Apache Cordova and NodeJS to build a shared list app

## Description
Every app I have used on Android to try to coordinate to do lists and grocery lists with my partner have been overcomplicated and cludgy. This app simplifies the process of creating shared lists, with an option to also create private lists on local phone storage.

## Environment Variables
- BASE_DIR: directory on server or local machine where this project lives. Used to create absolute path to sqlite files
